            <h4> STYLIST SAYING</h4>
            <p class="pteam"> Having a quick eye for balance, color, and harmony are essential for any florist looking to delight customers with stunning arrangements, so creativity is crucial. Being able to convey emotion and tone through cut flowers is a real skill, and a great florist brings a genuine love of the art to the table. Not only is a genuine love of flowers helpful in attracting attention for your beautiful designs, it also keeps you in the business for a long time without burning out. Love of the creative aspect of floristry transforms a job into a passion. </p>
